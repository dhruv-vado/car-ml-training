# car-ml-training
I tried training a car while using Unity as the simlutor (gone wrong)

the car-ml-training folder contains unity files. Import it to Unity as a project.

make sure to use python 3.10.0 for running the .py files.
all the dependencies are listed in requirements.txt, install them in a venv which uses python 3.10.0

Before running on Unity, run UnityFeed.py it will get connected when you run on unity. It will start capturing frames in /images and store the data in controls.csv. 
Remaining are some test files and data sorting files.
The already existing data there was recorded by me but after training with that I'm not getting the desired output yet.
(I did not upload the images as they were 2.5 gbs)
